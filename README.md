# array-impersonator

This application was built to easily impersonate users for troubleshooting purposes, by rendering the array components they see.

If you know the appKey and userToken for a user, you can pull up the components. You could do the same thing following the [public documentation on components](https://docs.array.com/docs/credit-report-api-flow), but this is saves you the hassle of editing your own HTML for every component, every time.

A live version of this application can be found here: [array-impersonator](https://array-impersonator.vercel.app/)
